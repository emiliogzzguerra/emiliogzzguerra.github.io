                    I was an exchange student in Hungary for a year. It was an experience that contributed to the person I am today. Throughout that year I had to think for myself, and take full responsibility over whatever happened. It was a year full of new knowledge and experiences. I broke my knee and I traveled around Europe for 20 days. I met a lot of people along the way and most importantly I got to know myself a little better. 
                </p>
                <p id="twotext">
                    I went to a 2 year High-school to be able to go to Hungary for an exchange. I learned a lot in these 2 years, it was a fresh start. I knew absolutely no one in this school and I was ready to meet some people. I started to get involved in things like chess tournaments. I won 3rd place in my generation, it was a pretty good experience. Throughout my high school years I played football as a Wide Receiver and then as a Defensive Lineman. A shoulder injury ended my football career. It was definitely worth it tho. 
                </p>
                <p id="threetext">
                    I stayed at "Colegio Ingles" for the rest of my junior high education, I got the opportunity to experience a few times a "United Nations Simulation" which helped me find that public speaking is a pretty challenging but cool thing to do. I also keept practicing soccer as the goalkeeper and also Football as a Wide Reciever.

                    My studies started in a school called "Mater" the main characteristic of this school is that they focus on the strengths of every kid, they let you choose what to learn so you can get better at it. It was an interesting system but it didn't contain any english :O. So on the 5th grade my mom found a way to transfer me to another school. 
                </p>
                <p id="fivetext">
                    So, you may be wondering why I placed this here, there's an interesting story that is worthy of telling. I was kicked out of my first kindergarten. The teachers said they had no idea what to do with me anymore, I used to finish my assignments and talk with my baby bros. My parents found another kindergarten where they found a way to drain all the energy out of me in a positive way. I was the teacher helper and also the magician in one of the school presentations.
