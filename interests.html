                Ever since I can remember I’ve been involved in sports activities, I started playing soccer when I was about 5 years old and kept playing until the end of Highschool (I would say 1/3 of the time I’ve played soccer I was in the center, and 2/3 of the time I was the goalkeeper). I’ve played Football for about 6 seasons, and tried out many positions (I started as an offensive lineman, then became a tightend, after that I played as a wide receiver and in my last season I played as a defensive lineman). 
                <br><br>
                On the last game I had as a Football player I got badly injured on my shoulder. That ended my football career. And while on exchange I broke my knee and got an arthroscopy on it. Ever since then it has been a bit harder to keep playing contact sports but anyways trying out new ways of doing sports is something interesting for me.

                Entrepreneurship has been on my veins for a long time now. I love watching TED talks, listening to podcasts like “Entrepreneur on fire” or “School of Greatness” and the books I read are usually about those kind of topics. I think it’s one of those topics that you can never get enough of. Even if you’re someone with a lot of experience there’s always something you haven’t been through. 
                <br><br>
                And that excites me. Possibilities. The fact that each and every one of us is able to leave a footprint in the world makes me want to do stuff. When something I’ve created helps someone do something better it makes it all worth it. All those hours working, all the tough times. 
                <br><br>
                I would also include public speaking over here, I’m looking for courses and opportunities to develop my public speaking skills.</p>
                <p id="threetext">
                I've found interesting to make movies, short clips. It's something really fresh, I think it all started when I got the opportunity to travel around Europe for 20 days. I wanted to document it all so I made little clips along the way. I've never edited those clips and I wanted to try out making a Vlog, in which I could express the way an entrepreneur feels. That's a project I'll be working in my free time. 
                </p>
                <p id="fourtext">
                There's no way I can't just walk up to a stranger that looks different and not say "Hey what's up?" I believe every single person in the world has something to teach you, I love to ask people about their culture and the way they're feeling in the place they're at. I'm currently learning Chinese in the hopes of one day being able to meet that culture.
