                First things first, I was an exchange student in Hungary for a year, 6 out of those 12 months I decided to dive into a software development company (August 2014 - June 2015). You may be wondering why? Well truth is I found myself really interested in learning how to create websites, applications and basically anything that had code in it. I realised I was spending about 4 hours every day learning how to code and I thought "Maybe if I could invest these 4 hours with someone that has already learned what I'm trying to learn I could learn faster”.
                <br><br>
                The whole experience was really good, I had the chance to “live” like a programmer for 6 months, funny thing is I tried to learn how to create applications the same way I learned Hungarian (Through experience) And after two weeks trying it out I concluded that learning through experience is way harder if you don’t have a base from where you can hold on to. 
                <br><br>
                I took a couple courses on Java programming through lynda.com, after feeling confident I could start building something I started to put the little knowledge I had to practice. I made a little app in which you could enter and set up a daily morning routine. The user was able to set a profile picture and change their name/password in the settings panel.
                <br><br>

                <iframe align="left" width="640" height="360" style="margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px"  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvMe52MhTUQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>
                    From January 2014 till June 2014 I worked in a Mexican startup called Zione.
                    <br><br>
                    It all started when my father told me he had a friend who was creating a business and he needed a graphic designer. By the time I had basic photoshop skills.
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to take my chances and try it out, maybe he would like what I could do. In the interview I was asked to create multiple images for the design of a website. I did my best and got the job done. The whole motivation behind this job opportunity was to get a chance to learn from someone who already built a whole platform by himself.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately I wasn't able to learn much due to the fact that it was a part time job and all the hours spent in the office were meant to be 100% efficient.I had a good time getting to know the company's culture and I designed many visual interfaces. This was my second professional experience, I learned on the go. Every day I learned something different, I realised that sometimes it's a good idea to take a break when working because you can get "Cycled" in a single idea or design. I recently found that that is also true when programming. I also learned how to manage my time effectively to deliver what I was asked for. Overall I feel like that was a really good professional experience.

                On christmas of 2013, I worked as an animator. This was my first professional experience ever. I would dress up as an Elf, Rudolf and only twice I got the chance to be Santa Claus. We went to all sort of events around Monterrey, my hometown.
                <br><br>
                It was hard to catch up with all the other experienced animators, they all knew the right things to say on several situations and none of them felt nervous when facing a big crowd. 
                <br><br>
                I remember the time I got the chance to represent Santa Claus in a kindergarden. I have to say, it was hard to fake my voice and talk in front of a 100 people room, but as time went on it became easier and easier to talk in front of a big audience.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>Things I learned:<b>

                <ol>
                  <li>I developed a lot my soft skills. </li>
                  <li>I developed my creativity to find the right words in a short amount of time. </li>
                  <li>I understood how much time and effort it takes to make some money. </li>
