                I created this website over the course of about 2 weeks. What took the most time to build it was to write down the content and what took even more time for this whole thing to be done is to record and edit the videos! 
                <br><br>
                Anyways, if I was asked to explain how I created this website I would simply answer I took a bootstrap template and slowly adapted it to fit my needs. I used JQuery to only change the content, and not refresh the whole page to show new content. (I used to do that in Worldwideslang for example) 
                <br><br>
                What I use to develop websites is basically Sublimetext, and MAMP. I develop them locally and then upload the changes through the Github Desktop app. I’m still checking out the way I can get a custom domain using Github pages still. As soon as I find out how to do it I’ll create a blog post about it. But for now my goal is to finish this whole online resume before the 25th of October to apply for Google’s internship program.

                Worldwide Slang was a project I came up with while I was an exchange student in Hungary. The idea is simple yet complex at the same time. It gives you the tools you need to start learning a new language wether you’re an exchange student, you’re someone who speaks more than one language or somebody who only speaks one language. And then invites you to share the knowledge you’ve acquired to a Facebook group in which everybody who has been through what you’ve been would be uploading their knowledge.
                <br><br>
                I built a group of people that resonated with that idea and we all worked on it for about 3 months. I basically built the whole site, and created most of the content. Created the Facebook Groups and contributed with 600 sentences. 
                <br><br>
                It may not have reached as many people as I would’ve wanted it to reach but truth is it was not a scalable business (I didn’t have the knowledge for it to be 100% automatised for it to work by itself) with that meaning that the amount of work we would’ve had to do would’ve been directly proportional to the amount of people using our service.

                It's a shame this was my first website and I have no record of it. It got vanished when we canceled the hosting in Godaddy. But anyways it was the beginning of what I'm doing right now so I'll just tell you a little bit about it.
                <br><br>
                Riskatest was born from a necessity that needed to be satisfied in a week. My brother needed me to help him determine wether a business idea of his would work or not. We couldn’t find a single website that had what he needed. He needed to ask a few questions that contained variables that changed every time a new user entered. That way he could obtain more information out of not so many users.
                <br><br>
                It was a success and the business my brother was putting to the test is currently working and it’s name is “Vinik” (www.vinik.com) </p>
